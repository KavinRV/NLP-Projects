In INS v. Chadha (1983), the Supreme Court decided (a) The prescription for legislative action in Art. I, ยง 1โrequiring all legislative powers to be vested in a Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representativesโand ยง 7โrequiring every bill passed by the House and Senate, before becoming law, to be presented to the president, and, if he disapproves, to be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and Houseโrepresents the Framers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure. This procedure is an integral part of the constitutional design for the separation of powers. Further rulings clarified the case; even both Houses acting together cannot override Executive vetos without a 2โ3 majority. Legislation may always prescribe regulations governing executive officers.\n","Prior to 1871, the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with Native Americans but the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1871 (ch. 120, 16 Stat. 563) had a rider (25 U.S.C. ยง 71) attached that effectively ended the Presidentโs treaty making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty. The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements, statutes, and executive orders.\n","The Constitution of the United States of America provides that the United States Congress has the power \"To coin money\". Laws implementing this power are currently codified at 31 U.S.C. ยง 5112. Section 5112 prescribes the forms, in which the United States dollars should be issued. These coins are both designated in Section 5112 as \"legal tender\" in payment of debts. The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar. The pure silver dollar is known as the American Silver Eagle. Section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins, which have values ranging from one cent to 50 dollars. These other coins are more fully described in Coins of the United States dollar.\n","The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.:220, 236โยงโ8,9) The \"space\" character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier, so it became position 20hex;:237โยงโ10 for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. The committee decided it was important to support uppercase 64-character alphabets, and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes,:228, 237โยงโ14 as was done in the DEC SIXBIT code. Lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase. To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter A was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.:238โยงโ18 The digits 0โ9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011, making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward.\n","The committee debated the possibility of a shift function (like in ITA2), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six-bit code. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.:215, 236โยงโ4\n","The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits (octets) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary-coded decimal. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired.:217, 236โยงโ5 Eight-bit machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.\n","Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a state prisoner is ordinarily only allowed one suit for habeas corpus in federal court. If the federal courts refuse to issue a writ of habeas corpus, an execution date may be set. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through a final round of federal litigation using the Civil Rights Act of 1871 โ codified at 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 โ which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.\n","Present-day statutes from across the nation use the same words and phrases, requiring modern executions to take place within a wall or enclosure to exclude public view. Connecticut General Statute ยง 54โ100 requires death sentences to be conducted in an \"enclosure\" which \"shall be so constructed as to exclude public view.\" Kentucky Revised Statute 431.220 and Missouri Revised Statute ยง 546.730 contain substantially identical language. New Mexico's former death penalty, since repealed, see N.M. Stat. ยง 31-14-12, required executions be conducted in a \"room or place enclosed from public view.\" Similarly, a dormant Massachusetts law, see Mass. Gen. Law ch. 279 ยง 60, required executions to take place \"within an enclosure or building.\" North Carolina General Statute ยง 15-188 requires death sentences to be executed \"within the walls\" of the penitentiary, as do Oklahoma Statute Title 22 ยง 1015 and Montana Code ยง 46-19-103. Ohio Revised Code ยง 2949.22 requires that \"[t]he enclosure shall exclude public view.\" Similarly, Tennessee Code ยง 40-23-116 requires \"an enclosure\" for \"strict seclusion and privacy.\" United States Code Title 18 ยง 3596 and the Code of Federal Regulations 28 CFR 26.4 limit the witnesses permitted at federal executions.\n","The first criminal provision in U.S. copyright law was added in 1897, which established a misdemeanor penalty for \"unlawful performances and representations of copyrighted dramatic and musical compositions\" if the violation had been \"willful and for profit.\" Criminal copyright infringement requires that the infringer acted \"for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.\" 17 U.S.C. ยง 506. To establish criminal liability, the prosecutor must first show the basic elements of copyright infringement: ownership of a valid copyright, and the violation of one or more of the copyright holder's exclusive rights. The government must then establish that defendant willfully infringed or, in other words, possessed the necessary mens rea. Misdemeanor infringement has a very low threshold in terms of number of copies and the value of the infringed works.\n","Trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The United States also has federal law in the form of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1831โ1839), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1831(a), criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1832, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as the United States.[citation needed]\n","Idealist notions took a strong hold among physicists of the early 20th century confronted with the paradoxes of quantum physics and the theory of relativity. In The Grammar of Science, Preface to the 2nd Edition, 1900, Karl Pearson wrote, \"There are many signs that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude materialism of the older physicists.\" This book influenced Einstein's regard for the importance of the observer in scientific measurements[citation needed]. In ยง 5 of that book, Pearson asserted that \"...science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind....\" Also, \"...the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.\"\n","The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA; 16 U.S.C. ยง 1531 et seq.) is one of the few dozens of United States environmental laws passed in the 1970s, and serves as the enacting legislation to carry out the provisions outlined in The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The ESA was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 28, 1973, it was designed to protect critically imperiled species from extinction as a \"consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation.\" The U.S. Supreme Court found that \"the plain intent of Congress in enacting\" the ESA \"was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost.\" The Act is administered by two federal agencies, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n","The \"Safe Harbor\" agreement is a voluntary agreement between the private landowner and FWS. The landowner agrees to alter the property to benefit or even attract a listed or proposed species in exchange for assurances that the FWS will permit future \"takes\" above a pre-determined level. The policy relies on the \"enhancement of survival\" provision of Section ยง1539(a)(1)(A). A landowner can have either a \"Safe Harbor\" agreement or an Incidental Take Permit, or both. The policy was developed by the Clinton Administration in 1999.\n","First, if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action (so called \"vertical\" direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from Kรผcรผkdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code ยง622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kรผcรผkdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.\n","--------------------------\n","Train list len:  87541\n","Valid list len:  34711\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train_df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"CqcpDTZDsY-F","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668478807629,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":427,"user":{"displayName":"Kavin R V 19163","userId":"16623310270923564772"}},"outputId":"a8d17642-0009-4ac2-a707-f862546fa9cc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                         id  \\\n","0  5733be284776f41900661182   \n","1  5733be284776f4190066117f   \n","2  5733be284776f41900661180   \n","3  5733be284776f41900661181   \n","4  5733be284776f4190066117e   \n","\n","                                             context  \\\n","0  Architecturally, the school has a Catholic cha...   \n","1  Architecturally, the school has a Catholic cha...   \n","2  Architecturally, the school has a Catholic cha...   \n","3  Architecturally, the school has a Catholic cha...   \n","4  Architecturally, the school has a Catholic cha...   \n","\n","                                            question       label  \\\n","0  To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear i...
